# Ns-3 PPDU Timeline Visualizer

A Qt-based visualization tool for **ns-3 PHY/MAC layer PPDU activity**, designed to provide an **interactive, time-aligned timeline view** of wireless transmissions.  

This project focuses on **PPDU-level visualization and analysis**, including:
- Multi-AP timelines
- Overlapping transmissions
- Hover-based inspection
- Time-range selection with automatic zoom
- Throughput / channel utilization statistics

It is intended as a **research and debugging tool** rather than a full simulator or NetAnim replacement.

## ✨ Features

- 📊 **PPDU Timeline View**  
  Visualize PPDU transmissions along a time axis, grouped by AP.

- 🧠 **Lane-based Overlap Layout**  
  Automatically splits overlapping PPDUs into lanes to avoid occlusion.

- 🖱 **Rich Interaction**
  - Hover to inspect PPDU details
  - Left-drag to pan timeline
  - Mouse wheel to zoom
  - Right-drag to select a time range

- 📐 **Time Range Analysis**
  For a selected time interval:
  - Channel busy time
  - Idle time
  - Utilization
  - Throughput (Mbps)

- 🪟 **Overlay UI (NetAnim-style)**
  Semi-transparent floating overlays for:
  - PPDU info
  - Legend
  - Statistics

- 🖼 **Export as Image**  
  Save the current timeline view as PNG / JPG.

```

> ⚠️ **Note**  
> `ns-3.46` is **not included** in this repository. You must build ns-3 separately and configure it to output trace data.

---

## 🔧 Dependencies

- **Qt 6** (Qt 5 may work with minor changes)
- **C++17** or newer
- **ns-3.46** (external)
- Linux (tested on Ubuntu)

---

## 🚀 Build & Run (Qt Part)

```bash
cd Visualization/Qt
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./Ns3Visualizer
```

> The Qt application **does not build or run ns-3**.  
> It only consumes PPDU-related data generated by ns-3.

---

## 📥 Data Input

Currently, PPDU data is expected to be provided via:
- ns-3 trace hooks
- Custom logging / JSON / CSV (project-specific)

Each PPDU is represented as a `PpduVisualItem`, including:
- Node ID (AP)
- Start / end time (ns)
- Frame type
- MPDU aggregation count
- Payload size

---

## 📈 Metrics Definition

For a selected time range `[T_start, T_end]`:

- **Busy Time**  
  Sum of PPDU durations overlapping the interval

- **Utilization**  
  ```
  busy_time / (T_end - T_start)
  ```

- **Throughput (Mbps)**  
  ```
  (total_bits_transmitted) / duration
  ```

Overlaps are handled proportionally by time intersection.

## 🧪 Project Status

- ✔ Core visualization complete
- ✔ Interactive timeline & overlays
- ✔ Time-range statistics
- ⏳ Data import standardization (WIP)
- ⏳ Multi-BSS / multi-channel support (future)

This is an **actively evolving research tool**.

---

## 🎯 Design Goals

- Focus on **PHY/MAC behavior**, not topology animation
- Precise time alignment (ns-level)
- Minimal abstraction between ns-3 trace and visualization
- Research-friendly, hackable codebase
